# Calcite Documentation Site

The Calcite docs site is a set of markdown files that are turned into a static site using [acetate](https://github.com/patrickarlt/acetate). To start the server when developing locally, go to the root of the project, make sure you have [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) installed globally and have already run `npm install`, then simply run `grunt`.

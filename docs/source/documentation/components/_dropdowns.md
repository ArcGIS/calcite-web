> Dropdowns rely on the `calcite-web.js` JavaScript library for their functionality. See the [JavaScript Documentation](../javascript/) for more information.

Dropdowns are good for showing multiple options under a single call to action. For example, if you had a download button, and you needed the user to choose a format for the download, you could put several choices in a dropdown.

Dropdowns differ from `select` elements in that they don't have a default state or a 'current' state. Instead, they offer a jumping off point for a series of related actions.

**Note:** Dropdowns recently started using inline svg icons rather than the icon font for the triangle on the right. If you'd prefer to continue using the icon font, just set the Sass variable `$include-svg-icon` to `false`.

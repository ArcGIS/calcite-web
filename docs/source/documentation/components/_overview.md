Components are reusable design elements that can be used across any part of an experience built with Calcite. They can be very small and simple (like a [label](#label)), or more complex and interactive (like a [dropdown](#dropdowns)).

Most components stand on their own, but some interactive components require JavaScript to function properly. Read the [JavaScript documentation](../javascript) to learn how to install and set up `calcite-web.js` on your site.

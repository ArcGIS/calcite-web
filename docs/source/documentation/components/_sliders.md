This is our plain slider. More functionality may come in the form of a sliders.js helper, in the future.

All four major browsers render sliders differently. We've done our best to ensure a consistent display, however some browsers have support for elements not allowed in others. For example, Edge and Firefox natively allow for a progress pseudo: element, which we've styled here. Chrome and Safari allow the appending of datalists and options as tick marks, which we've allowed to display here but do not enforce styles upon.

We recommend placing your range inside a label to ensure property highlighting and click / hover functionality.

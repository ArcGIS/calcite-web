Calcite web exposes a set of Sass variables for the UI palette. The primary colors used for interface development should be neutrals.

In addition to the gray-scale color values, three spot colors are also provided. Blue, red, and green. Each of these spot colors is available in a range of six values from lightest to darkest.

If you're using Sass, the complete [calcite-colors](https://github.com/Esri/calcite-colors/blob/master/colors.scss) set is also available.

Three basic colors are set for color in typography. It's not recommended to change these values, but they are provided for your reference.

```scss
$type-color: $off-black;
$link-color: $blue;
$link-hover: $light-blue;
```

In writing Sass it's often easier to remember `$type-color` is the color of type than it is to remember the specific grayscale value that is the default for type.

<div class="panel panel-white leader-1 trailer-1 inline-block">
{% icon 'article', size=24, classes="svg-icon margin-right-half" %} To find accessible color combinations for type, use the color finder tool: <a href="{{relativePath}}/guides/a11y/#color-finder" class="btn btn-clear margin-left-half">Color finder{% icon 'launch', size=16, classes="svg-icon svg-icon-after" %}</a>
</div>

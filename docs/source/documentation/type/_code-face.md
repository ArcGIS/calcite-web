Designed by Microsoft's Lucas DeGroot, [Consolas](http://www.fonts.com/font/microsoft-corporation/consolas) is a clean, readable, and simple monospace face for documenting code blocks. For users that don't have Consolas installed, Calcite Web will fallback to Andale Mono, Lucida Console, or Monaco.

Rather than load a specific font for code blocks, Calcite Web is designed to use a system font. For users that have Consolas installed, it is the preferred face for code blocks. Designed by Microsoft's Lucas DeGroot, [Consolas](http://www.fonts.com/font/microsoft-corporation/consolas) is a clean, readable, and simple monospace face for documenting code blocks.

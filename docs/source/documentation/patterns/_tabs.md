<p class='leader-half trailer-0 font-size--1'>

Tabs have been given a visual update in this release. `tabs-gray`, `tabs-transparent`, `tabs-translucent` have been removed. Please use either `tabs` or `tabs-dark` styles.
</p>
<p class='leader-half trailer-0 font-size--1'>

Styling has been removed from `tab-contents` - the class is used solely to show and hide the contents. You can add padding or text styling to the container with [helper classes](/quick-reference/ "Calcite Web Quick Reference").
</p>
</div>

The framework includes a quick set of styles for a tabbed interface pattern. The full tab container will expand to fit its parent.

As an added bonus, this component supports intelligently restricting the width of tabs if they get too long and numerous.

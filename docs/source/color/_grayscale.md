## Grayscale
Calcite Web has mostly deals with large-field layouts and a broader range of visual communication, including small interfaces and long format reading. With this in mind, Calcite Web's grayscale differs from that of Calcite Desktop.

Short, semantic names provide a broad range of tones across a smooth color ramp, with much attention paid to avoiding spectrum crunch at either end of the scale. All grays are completely neutral in hue, so may be used with either warm of cold color schemes.

## Responsive Leader And Trailer

Leader and trailer classes also have additional responsive `tablet-` and `phone-` prefix classes. These allow you to add different amounts of space above and below an element at different screen sizes.

For example, if you wanted an element to have 3 lines of margin above it on desktop, but that was too much on a phone, you could use responsive classes to specify that:

```
<div class="leader-3 phone-leader-1"></div>
```

These also apply to `padding-leader` and `padding-trailer`

## Scroll Show and Hide
Some layouts call for elements to appear or disapear as the user scrolls down the page. An element with the `scroll-show` class will appear when it reaches a point specified by the `data-show-top=x` attribute, appearing when it comes within the given value of the top of the screen.

An element with the `scroll-hide` class will disappear when it reaches a point specified by the `data-hide-top=x` attribute, disappearing when the window scrolls past a given point.

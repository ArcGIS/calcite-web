# Forms
The forms section provides basic styling of form elements in addition to a basic reset.

Labels for form elements should describe what the field is, while placeholder text should describe the specifics about formatting or examples for the input text.

## Text Inputs

All text inputs are styled by default. They receive a 1px border, a CSS3 transition, and a very distinct :focus style which helps provide feedback to the user while they engage with a form. The size of the forms and buttons are calibrated to they can exist in-line to each other.

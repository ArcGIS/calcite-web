## Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs are a set of links or spans inside of a `<nav>` element. The `crumb` class will take care of spacing, alignment, and icons. Normal [text]({{relativePath}}/type/#text-color) and [link]({{relativePath}}/type/#link-color) helpers can be applied to breadcrumbs to allow for a range of contexts.

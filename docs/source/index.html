## A Design & Development Framework.

Calcite Web is a branded CSS & JavaScript framework, web style guide, and visual language design catalog for Esri. You can use Calcite Web to quickly build on-brand, lightweight, and accessible websites. The robust codebase is well supported, steadily maintained, and always being improved.

Calcite Web contains everything you need to quickly build excellent web sites out of the box, with no configuration or set up. A collection of [extensions](#) for the framework provide sets of patterns that can be used for specific use cases, including [marketing pages](#), [e-commerce](#), and application [dashboards](#).

The sass-based system allows for use a dependency for creating branded themes for other front end frameworks, custom application-specific extensions, and other developer-friendly uses.

### Start Building Today

Getting started with Calcite Web is as easy as copy paste. The [Quickstart Guide](/examples) explains how to [include the framework](/documentation) in your project, lay out basic page structures with the [grid system](/documentation/grid), and use the [UI Patterns](/documentation/patterns) to present content.

### Comprehensive & Extendable

Calcite Web has all the building blocks you need to create most projects, but sometimes you might need a little extra. This is why we've created a set of extensions to Calcite Web to handle situations like [e-commerce](/examples/e-commerce), [splashy marketing pages](/examples/marketing), and [web applications](/examples/apps). Just include a line of CSS, and start working from the examples.

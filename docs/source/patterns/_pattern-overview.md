<h1 class="leader-0">Calcite Web Patterns</h1>

Patterns are specific UI schemes that use a collection of [components]({{relativePath}}/components) and pattern-specific css to solve a common design problem. Patterns can either stand alone entirely as markup, or be dependent on [Javascript]({{relativePath}}/javscript) to accomplish certain behaviors.

To use a pattern, follow the structures defined in the sample code.

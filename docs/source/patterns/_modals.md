## Modals

Modals are meant to "take over" the screen and focus users attention on a dialog which presents the user with an opportunity to add, modify or create content. A modal should always be centered both vertically and horizontally within the browser window. When a modal is opened, the interface darkens and disables all other user interface elements in order to force a user to take an action required by their workflow.

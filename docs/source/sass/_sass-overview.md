# SASS

Using Calcite Web as a SASS library is very powerful. After you successfully import the library (see [the getting started page]({{relativepath}})) you can fully customize and use all of the Calcite Web Framework.

## Custom Build

Calcite comes with the ability to only generate the css you actually need for your project.

## Configuration

You can configure quite a bit in Calcite Web including grid settings, typography defaults, etc.

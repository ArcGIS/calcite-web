<h1 class="leader-0">Calcite-Web</h1>

Calcite Web is a CSS framework built in SASS. It also includes a small, vanilla JavaScript library that allows you to have interactive patterns in your site like tabs, modals, etc. Calcite Web is a web-adaptation of the Calcite framework that was developed for ArcGIS Pro. The idea is to have designs be consistent, but also embrace the characteristics that make each medium unique.

Calcite Web was built *for* developers. It is meant to be flexible enough that you can accomplish 80% of your website with the default patterns. If you use Calcite Web as a Sass library, you'll also get a set of very helpful mixins to help you make new patterns and components that fit in with the Calcite methodology and aesthetic.

# Using Calcite-Web

There are two main ways to use Calcite-Web: copying static files into your project and installing via a package manager. Obviously, installing as a Sass library will give you the most power, but whatever your flavor, we probably have you covered.

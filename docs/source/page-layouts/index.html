## Example Layouts

Below are several layouts that demonstrate how to accomplish common page types in Calcite Web. In general, there are enough stock patterns and components that creating these pages doesn't require writing any CSS at all. These layouts can act as a good starting point to creating a page with Calcite Web.

- [Blog](./blog/)
- [Documentation](./documentation/)
- [API Reference](./api-reference/)
- [Homepage](./homepage/)
- [Product Page](./product/)

## Demo Pages

We also provide several pages which demonstrate certain aspects of Calcite Web.

- [Kitchen Sink](./kitchen-sink/)
- [Grid](./grid/)
- [Type Comparison](./type-comparison/)

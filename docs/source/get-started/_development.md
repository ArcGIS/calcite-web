## Development

To run a development environment, just type `grunt`. You should have a copy of the documentation site live at `localhost:8888`. As you develop features and fix bugs, be sure to write notes in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## How We Use GitHub

All the code for Calcite-Web lives [on GitHub](https://github.com/arcgis/calcite-web). We use the [fork and pull model](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) to manage contribution. To contribute, you should:

1. Get a GitHub account.
2. Get access to the repository if you don't have it already by emailing a contributor
3. Fork the repository so you have your own copy.
4. Open a pull-request

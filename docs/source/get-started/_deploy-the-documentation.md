# Updating the Documentation Site

To update the documentation site, just make sure you have push access to the `ArcGIS/calcite-web` repo and type `grunt deploy`. This will build the site and deploy to gh-pages.

The site should be updated at http://arcgis.github.io/calcite-web/ in just a few moments.

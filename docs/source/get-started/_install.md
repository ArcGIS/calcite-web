# Contributing to Calcite Web

Installing Calcite Web was designed to be fairly painless. If you have any problems, be sure to [submit an issue](https://github.com/Esri/calcite-web/issues/).

### Install Dependencies

Calcite Web has three main dependencies. If you already have these on your computer, you can skip these steps:

1. Visit [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org/) to install Node.
2. `npm install -g grunt-cli` to install Grunt.
3. `gem install sass` to install SASS.

### Fork the Repository

All the code for Calcite Web lives [on GitHub](https://github.com/esri/calcite-web). We use the [fork and pull model](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) to manage contribution.

1. Fork the repository so you have your own copy (`your-username/calcite-web`)
2. Clone the repo locally with `git clone https://github.com/your-username/calcite-web`
3. Move into the clone repo:  `cd calcite-web`
4. Install project dependencies: `npm install`

You should also add `Esri/calcite-web` as a remote at this point. We generally call this remote branch 'upstream':

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Esri/calcite-web
```

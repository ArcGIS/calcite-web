## Word Spacing

Word spacing is - well - the space between words.  The `word-spacing($n)` mixin accepts an integer, and applies letterspacing to the element as fractions of 1/1000 of an em.
`@include word-spacing(500)` will apply 1/2 em word spacing.
`@include word-spacing(166)` will apply a hairline em word spacing.

## Body Face

While there is no official Esri brand typeface for long for applications, Calcite Web employs [Frutiger](http://www.fonts.com/font/linotype/frutiger?QueryFontType=Web) for this purpose. Frutiger evokes some of the stronger qualities of our default typefaces - Lucida Grande and Segoe UI - while presenting a consistent voice across platforms. Frutiger pairs remarkably well with Avenir, as they are both designed by Adrian Frutiger, with strong influences from Univers.

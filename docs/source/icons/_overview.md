## Overview

Icons in Calcite-Web come in two different flavors: one color and multi-color. The one color (or monochromatic) icon set is delivered as an icon font. The multi-color icons are delivered as a set of SVG icons with corresponsponding icon classes.

Both sets can be called in the same way from your html. to display a download icon, for example:

```html
<span class="icon-download"></span>
```

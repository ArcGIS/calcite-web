## Color Icons

Color icons can't be delivered as an icon font, so they are delivered as basic SVG files. These icons generally describe specific tools, and are largely based on the official Calcite icon set used in Desktop.

You cannot change the colors of these icons, but you can change the size. Full color icons are designed at specific sizes. You can use these sizes with size modifier classes. When you use `icon-small` you will automatically use the icon design that is specified for the smaller size. Often times the smaller icons are reduced visually with less detail so as to remain legible.

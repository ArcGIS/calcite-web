## 1. Use type sizes and styles meaningfully

Type size can help users understand what is most important in your design. Try to ensure that the most essential and top-level information is in larger type, while ancillary or supplemental information remains smaller. While contrived, the below example demonstrates the idea:

<div class="column-16">
  <div class="column-8 first-column">
    <span class="label label-red">Incorrect:</span>
    <div class="panel panel-white leader-half trailer-quarter">
      <p>Most important</p>
      <p>Least important</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="column-8 trailer-1">
    <span class="label label-green">Correct:</span>
    <div class="panel panel-white leader-half trailer-quarter">
      <p class="font-size-3 trailer-half">Most important</p>
      <p class="font-size-0">Least important</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<hr class="column-16">

<div class="column-16">
  <div class="column-6 leader-5 tablet-leader-0">
    <h2>Type scale</h2>
    <p>Text sizes in Calcite Web are defined by a <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/more-meaningful-typography">modular scale</a>. By default, font sizes range from <code>-3</code> to <code>8</code> with <code>0</code> being the default. You can use the <a href="../../documentation/type/#text-size">helper classes</a> or the <code>font-size()</code> <a href="../sass/#font-size">mixin</a> to leverage the typographic scale.</p>
    <p>As a general rule try not to use type smaller than <code>-1</code> for long-form text as it's hard to read small text for long periods of time.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="column-10">
    <p class="text-right trailer-quarter font-size--3">font-size--3</p>
    <p class="text-right trailer-quarter font-size--2">font-size--2</p>
    <p class="text-right trailer-quarter font-size--1">font-size--1</p>
    <p class="text-right trailer-quarter font-size-0">font-size-0</p>
    <p class="text-right trailer-quarter font-size-1">font-size-1</p>
    <p class="text-right trailer-quarter font-size-2">font-size-2</p>
    <p class="text-right trailer-quarter font-size-3">font-size-3</p>
    <p class="text-right trailer-quarter font-size-4">font-size-4</p>
    <p class="text-right trailer-quarter font-size-5">font-size-5</p>
    <p class="text-right trailer-quarter font-size-6">font-size-6</p>
    <p class="text-right trailer-quarter font-size-7">font-size-7</p>
    <p class="text-right trailer-quarter font-size-8">font-size-8</p>
  </div>
</div>

<hr class="column-16">

### Weight and style

In addition to text size, the weight of the text (how bold or light it appears) and style (italic vs. roman) are additional tools that can help to build meaningful hierarchy into your designs. Weight and style can be used via [helper classes](../../documentation/type/#avenir) (below), or through the [font-family mixins](../../documentation/sass/#font-families). Use bold to help users identify points of emphasis and selected states.

<table class="table table-plain trailer-0">
  <thead>
    <th>Font families</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><p class="font-size-2 trailer-0 avenir-light">avenir-light</p></td>
      <td><p class="font-size-2 trailer-0 avenir-regular">avenir-regular</p></td>
      <td><p class="font-size-2 trailer-0 avenir-italic">avenir-italic</p></td>
      <td><p class="font-size-2 trailer-0 avenir-bold">avenir-bold</p></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<hr class="column-16 trailer-3">

## 2. Use a readable line length

When displaying large portions of text, it's important to ensure that the line length (how many characters display before wrapping) not be too long or too short. Long line lengths make blocks of text very difficult to read. Try to keep line-length between 50-90 characters long if possible.

<div class="column-24 first-column">
  <div class="column-20">
    <span class="label label-red">Incorrect:</span>
    <div class="panel panel-white leader-half trailer-quarter">
      <p class="trailer-0">This paragraph is inside a <code>column-20</code>. This text is <code>font-size-0</code>. At the largest screen size, when the <code>grid-container</code> is maximized, a column-20 is about 1200 pixels wide. Because of this, it fits about 160 characters in a line. You may notice while reading this that it feels more difficult to find the next line and stay focused on the content.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="column-17 first-column">
  <div class="column-3 trailer-1 leader-1">
    <span class="label label-red">Incorrect:</span>
    <div class="panel panel-white leader-half trailer-quarter">
      <p class="trailer-0">This text is in a <code>column-3</code>. At only 15-25 characters, it is too short.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="column-9 trailer-1 leader-1">
    <span class="label label-green">Correct:</span>
    <div class="panel panel-white leader-half trailer-quarter">
      <p class="trailer-1">This text is in a <code>column-9</code>. At the max size it will fit about 55-70 characters, placing it well within the correct range for readable line length.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="column-16 trailer-3">
  <div class="column-12">
    <div class="panel panel-white flex">
      <span class="flex-0">{% icon 'lightbulb', size=24, classes="svg-icon margin-right-half" %}</span>
      <em class="flex-1 font-size--1">If you're using the default 24-column grid, consider 17 columns the largest width for a readable line length.</em>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

## 3. Use vertical space to aid comprehension

Line height (or leading) is the vertical space between lines of text. Calcite Web by default provides a generous line height. Most of the time you won't have to mess with line-height. If you do need to alter line-height, the `leading($n)` [mixin](../../documentation/sass/#leading) allows you to base your spacing off the `$baseline` unit.

Another way to help users quickly parse content is to add vertical space between distinct controls and elements. Using whitespace enables you to communicate to the user what elements should be grouped and related.

The below example helps illustrate these concepts:

<div class="column-16 first-column">
  <div class="column-8">
    <span class="label label-red">Incorrect:</span>
    <div class="panel panel-white leader-half trailer-quarter">
      <h4 class="trailer-1">First Thing</h4>
      <p style="line-height: .875;" class="trailer-0">This is the first element, which should be grouped with its header. Notice that when the vertical space is not intentional, it's hard to know which header describes which paragraph.</p>
      <h4 class="trailer-1">Second Thing</h4>
      <p style="line-height: .875;">This is the second element, and it is described by this paragraph.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="column-8 trailer-1">
    <span class="label label-green">Correct:</span>
    <div class="panel panel-white leader-half trailer-quarter">
      <h4 class="trailer-quarter">First Thing</h4>
      <p class="trailer-1">This is the first element, which should be grouped with its header. Notice that we are reducing the space between the header and the paragraph and increasing space between the two paragraphs.</p>
      <h4 class="trailer-quarter">Second Thing</h4>
      <p>By using the standard line-height, we also made it much easier to read. With these examples combined you can see how vertical space can have a substantial impact on a user's experience.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>


## 4. Avoid centering long form text

### Internationalization

Almost every major language is styled for you, automatically. In most Latin-based languages, everything can be rendered in Avenir Next. Some languages, however, use characters that aren't included in Avenir Next. For each of these languages, Calcite Web will load a font that maintains a similar look and feel.

Non-Latin character sets are pulled in only when needed, so if your application is in English, the browser will only load the files it needs for displaying English. This is accomplished by using the `unicode-range` property in the `@font-face` declaration. To learn more about internationalization and to see all of the languages that Calcite Web supports, check out the [localization guide](../localization/).

### Use Behind a Firewall

Fonts in Calcite Web are loaded from the Esri CDN, but if you are working on an Esri product that will be deployed behind a firewall, you can also host the files yourself, locally.

For more instructions on setting up locally-hosted fonts, view the [Calcite Fonts](https://github.com/ArcGIS/calcite-fonts) project. *Note:* due to license restrictions these files can only be made available for Esri product teams.

### Vertical Rhythm

Vertical rhythm is maintained in the Calcite Web Type System by the use of the `$baseline` variable. `$baseline` sets a standard and regular leading in relation to the body copy â€“ 1.5rem. This variable is used for any measurement on the vertical axis in the page, including the [leader and trailer grid helper classes](../grid/#leader-and-trailer) and padding for [components like buttons](../components/#buttons) which use standard measurements like `3/$baseline` and `2/$baseline`.

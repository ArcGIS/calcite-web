# calcite-ui-icons

A collection of UI SVG icons created by Esri for mapping applications.
https://esri.github.io/calcite-ui-icons/

## Installation

`npm install @esri/calcite-ui-icons --save`

## Description

Icons come in two styles:

* **filled**
* **outlined**

and 3 sizes:

* **16x16**
* **24x24**
* **32x32**

### Why 3 Sizes?

More info on what happens when you scale vector based icons [here](https://github.com/Esri/calcite-ui-icons/wiki/What-Happens-When-You-Scale-Vector-Based-Icons)

### Outline icons are the standard
Outline icons have the default name. For eample, `trash-16.svg` will render the default outline icon.

If needed, appending `-f` (`trash-16-f.svg`) will render the filled version.

**Outline icons should be the primary icons to be used.**

### Sprite packages
Furtheremore, sprites are available in 6 packages and live ouside the `icons/` directory:

* sprite-16.svg
* sprite-16-f.svg
* sprite-24.svg
* sprite-24-f.svg
* sprite-32.svg
* sprite-32-f.svg

Filenames that contain `-f` contain filled icons only.
Icons in the sprite have an `id` of the individual SVG file name.

### JSON Format

All icons are also provided as part of a JSON file. If you installed via npm, requiring the library will give you access to all the icons and their path data:

```js
var calciteIcons = require('@esri/calcite-ui-icons');
```

This will give you an object containing all the icons in the library at all sizes in outlined and filled styles:

```js
{
  version: '{current version number}',
  icons: {
    blog: {
      alias: ['social'],
      category: 'Social-Media',
      filled: {
        16:['M15.541...'],
        24:['M23.756...'],
        32:['M31.618...']
      },
      outline: {
        16:['M15.541...'],
        24:['M23.756...'],
        32:['M31.618...']
      }
    },
    ...
  }
}
```
_Note: path data ommitted for brevity_.

### Individual icons structure
All the individual SVG icons have a common file structure.

This is what the `close-16.svg` looks like:

```
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 16 16">
  <path d="M0 10V7h10.965l-5-5H9.5L16 8.5 9.5 15H5.964l5-5H0z"/>
</svg>
```

None of the icons have `stroke` attributes. The `fill` attribute can be defined with css:

```
svg {
  fill: gray;
}
```

All the other styling properties applicable to the whole svg element are applicable.

```
svg:hover {
  fill: blue;
}
```
